This summer I’ve been living in downtown Chattanooga while completing a PR internship with a local utility company. This was my final requirement for graduation, and although I didn’t have the opportunity to walk across the stage, I’m still proud to now call myself a Lee alum.</p><p>Today I set out on a new adventure - one that I’ve dreamed about for a long time. For the next two months, I’ll be traveling through five states while hopping to a new Airbnb each week. Assuming this trial run goes well, the goal is to begin full-time travel while working online.</p><p>The timing is... less than ideal, but I’m excited for whatever comes next (this also felt like a good time to re-download Instagram). Here’s to conquering new challenges, learning new things, and drinking lots of tea along the way!","tooltip":"The Beginning","title":"The Start of a New Adventure"},

Most tea is grown in Southeast Asia, but the soil and climate of Wadmalaw Island are perfect for cultivating tea. Supposedly this is the only place on the United States mainland where tea is grown at commercial scale. Without any domestic competition, they’ve been the de facto choice to provide the official White House tea since 1987.</p><p>The plantation was once independently owned, but after falling on hard times, it was bought by the Bigelow Company. Now the appropriately renamed Charleston Tea Garden is primarily run as a tourist attraction.</p><p>I enjoyed walking the tea fields and touring the factory, where I watched tea leaves being processed, oxidized, and packaged for sale. I stocked up on some of the current year’s harvest (a first flush black loose leaf), and it’s easily some of the best tea I’ve ever had.</p><hr><p>While in Charleston, I walked by Mother Emanuel - the African Methodist Episcopal Church where nine black congregants were murdered by a white supremacist in 2015. As I approached the church, I noticed a memorial honoring the lives lost. I stood there for a moment, reading the names and reflecting on the significance of the horrific tragedy.</p><p>I continued my walk until something caught my eye. Not even a full block away from the church was a park. And proudly towering over the park was a massive stone statue honoring the legacy of a general in the Confederate Army. The irony was sickening.</p><hr><p>One afternoon I went to a cozy coffee shop in Charleston’s historic district to get some work done on my laptop. After ordering my cup of tea, I settled into the only available seat - a massive booth, perhaps capable of holding six people.</p><p>A few minutes into my work, I noticed a disheveled man who walked in wearing a full business suit. He ordered a coffee, looked around, and reluctantly made his way back outside. Juggling his bag and a few loose papers, he sat directly in the sun on a flimsy metal patio chair and balanced his laptop on his knees. With the August heat and relentless humidity, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for him.</p><p>I poked my head outside and invited him to join me. He looked so relieved, mentioning a looming deadline for an important project. We acknowledged the awkwardness of sharing space with a stranger during a time when social distancing was the norm. But we made it work, both masked and sitting across from each other at opposite ends of the booth. Despite the odd circumstances and sterile environment, I was grateful for the momentary connection.","tooltip":"Charleston, SC","title":"Charleston, SC","gallery":["charleston1.jpg","charleston2.jpg","charleston3.jpg","charleston4.jpg","charleston5.jpg","charleston6.jpg","charleston7.jpg"]},
