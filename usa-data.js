This summer I‚Äôve been living in downtown Chattanooga while completing a PR internship with a local utility company. This was my final requirement for graduation, and although I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to walk across the stage, I‚Äôm still proud to now call myself a Lee alum.</p><p>Today I set out on a new adventure - one that I‚Äôve dreamed about for a long time. For the next two months, I‚Äôll be traveling through five states while hopping to a new Airbnb each week. Assuming this trial run goes well, the goal is to begin full-time travel while working online.</p><p>The timing is... less than ideal, but I‚Äôm excited for whatever comes next (this also felt like a good time to re-download Instagram).
